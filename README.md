# GenSys-LTL
This branch hosts the code for the tool: GenSys-LTL (i.e., [GenSys](https://github.com/stanlysamuel/gensys) Version 2.0), based on our [ASE 2023 paper](https://conf.researchr.org/details/ase-2023/ase-2023-papers/101/Symbolic-Fixpoint-Algorithms-for-Logical-LTL-Games): *Symbolic Fixpoint Algorithms for Logical LTL Games.*

## Introduction 

GenSys-LTL is an *infinite-state* reactive synthesis solver using LTL specifications. GenSys-LTL uses the Z3 theorem prover by Microsoft Research for solving and projecting SMT formulae. GenSys-LTL is scalable and is validated on standard benchmarks with compelling results.

For the extended arXiv version of the [ASE 2023 paper](https://conf.researchr.org/details/ase-2023/ase-2023-papers/101/Symbolic-Fixpoint-Algorithms-for-Logical-LTL-Games), please see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02427) titled: *Towards Efficient Controller Synthesis Techniques for Logical LTL Games*.
